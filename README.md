# CFAN
The Comprehensive Flight simulator Archive Network. Yes the name is similar to CPAN/CKAN.

## Purpose
CFAN should be an easy to use community Content Manager for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, to allow regular users to simply install, update and remove of Airplanes, Scenery, Liveries and other mods. The content must be free, but the license, rights, code, maintenance, hosting and publication are to be managed by the content owner. 
If there is a better content manager available, this project will probably be stopped to avoid scattering of places where to find content for Microsoft Flight Simulator.

## State
The projects is currently in project planning state. We're trying to figure out the best approach how to realize this project, and are building the code structure. No active development is done.
